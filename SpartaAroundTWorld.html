                        Sparta is a city and the county seat of White County, Tennessee, United States. The population was 5,001 in 2020. The Calfkiller River flows through the city. Seven sites in Sparta are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. (Wikipedia webpage)
                        From rambling farms that hearken back to a simpler time, to a musical heritage that has brought the area renown as one of the nation's top resonators of the bluegrass roots movement, White County and Sparta, TN, have become a haven for history buffs, music fans and nature lovers alike.

                    <br>
                    <p>Sparta nearly became the capital of the state of Tennessee, as, early in the history of Tennessee, the state legislature voted to choose a location for the permanent state capital. The final vote resulted in a near tie between Sparta and Nashville. Sparta lost to Nashville by one vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sparta grew quickly due to its location along the stage road between Knoxville and Nashville. In the 1830s, brothers Barlow and Madison Fisk built the Sparta Rock House, which served as an inn along the stage road. The Rock House, strategically situated in an area where the Cumberland Plateau gives way to the Calfkiller valley, was a common stopover for figures important to the early history of the state, including Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston. The building is now a state historic site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Seeing as there was already a Nashville in Michigan, the state legislature suggested Sparta, meaning land of the fair women. The village was platted in 1867 and incorporated in 1883.

                        Nueva Esparta was founded on 15 December 1838, by Colombian Colonel Narciso Benítez, a leader in the Republican Army of Liberator Simón Bolívar. The original population consisted of Honduran immigrants who had ably fought beside General Francisco Morazán's troops—they battled so courageously that Francisco Morazán called the Honduran soldiers ¨my valiant Spartans¨ (an homage to the renowned warriors of Ancient Greek city-state Sparta, who fought back Persian aggressors with only 300 troops). Thus the city came to be known as Nueva Esparta, or “New Sparta.”

                    <P>On December 15, 1841, The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador granted Nueva Esparta the title of “Pueblo,” belonging to the district of San Antonio El Sauce, San Miguel. June 22, 1865, the pueblo was annexed into the Department of La Unión. February 9, 1883, Nueva Esparta came to form part of the district of Santa Rosa de Lima. March 10, 1892, under the administration of General Carlos Ezeta, Nueva Esparta was declared a “Village” (Villa). March 29, 1966, President Coronel Julio Adalberto Rivera granted Nueva Esparta the title of “City.”

                        Isparta was said to correspond to the ancient city of Baris, which is a namesake and was part of the Roman province of Pisidia. A later theory has it instead as the Eastern Roman fortress Saporda; in Muslim sources it appears as Sabarta. GE Bean characterized the situation thus: "These perpetually shifting conceptions leave the reader quite bewildered." Modern scholars locate Baris near Kılıç, in Keçiborlu district, Isparta province.

                    <P>At an early stage it became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolitan see of Antioch of Pisidia, the capital of the province. The names of two of its bishops are known with certainty: Heraclius participated in the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and Leo in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In addition, Paulus was at the Council of Constantinople (869) and Stephanus was at the Council of Constantinople (879), but one or both of these may have been of the Baris in the Roman province of Hellespontus. Like most sees in Asia Minor, it faded away.

                    <p> Sparta, Ontario, was once a flourishing settlement in Yarmouth County known as “The Corners.” The Attawandaron (Neutrals) was the first group in the region alongside the Haudenosaunee and Algonquin peoples. The village of Sparta was established in 1813 when Jonathan Doan travelled down Lake Erie by flat-bottomed barge to Kettle Creek looking for a safer place to start a Quaker settlement.
                    </p>  
                    <BR>
                    <P>Originally from the United States, Doan fled to the Niagara region before finally settling in Sparta over fears of losing his property for a second time. He purchased 200 acres in Sparta and eventually encouraged other Quakers from around Niagara to move to the area for its rich farming and endless opportunities.</P>    
                    <BR>
                    <p>Doan and his family set up a grist mill, sawmill and tannery. Prior to this, settlers had to either use their plumping mills or transport their grain all the way to Long Point for grinding into flour. Doan was also a land agent for over 3,000 acres in Sparta, which provided the space for the Society of Friends (Quaker) Cemetery and meeting house. The first meeting house was a little log building on the corner of Jonathan Doan’s farm. In 1821, a small frame building replaced the old structure and in 1865, a new site was chosen to construct the present meeting house.

                        The naming of Sparta happened in 1834 with a meeting of landowners. It’s unclear how the name was determined but many think it had to do with the classical trend of the day. Troy, now known as Alymer, was nearby, and so was the village of Corinth.
                        
                        In 1837, the community became involved in the Rebellion of 1837 and many fled to the United States. Joshua Doan, son of Jonathan was one of the rebels and was captured at the attack on Windsor and hung for treason in 1839. After the rebellion, many Sparta residents gradually returned to their homes from the United States.</p>
